Date: 1/17/18
Team Members: Jaiveer Singh, Christy Koh, Noah Boursier
Description:
This assignment was a lesson in using backend file hosting in apps as well as the use of interfaces and abstract classes.
Team member roles in assignment: (Who did what)
Christy worked on the actual application used as a live demo of the functionality.
Jaiveer helped with the application and worked on the presentation.
Noah focused on the presentation itself and researching the backendless docs thoroughly.
Key Lessons learned:
Summarize what you think important teaching points from the lesson were.  
In general, we realized that utilizing BaaS can help reduce the amount of programming developers need to do for their apps, while simultaneously improving the end user interface. Since major companies can specialize in providing BaaS, developers no longer have to worry about the details involved in account management or file access. Ultimately, BaaS and Backendless can be extremely useful platforms from which to develop more useful apps. 
Conclusion Questions
1)  What are the benefits of adding a back end for an application? 
Backends are useful for making data persistent and ensuring that applications can communicate across devices. Additionally, the backend can host files to help reduce the storage taken up on the client device.

2) What is a Backend as a Service and how does it work? Include as much detail as you can about the infrastructure and implementation.  Include any interesting notes from class presentations.
BaaS involves a major company purchasing large servers and allowing other app developers to utilize their storage space for their own apps. The infrastructure itself is managed by the company; the company also typically offers simple tools for app developers to easily implement desired functionality.
